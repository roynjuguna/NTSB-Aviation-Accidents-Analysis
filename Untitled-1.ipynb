    "---\n",
    "**Author**: Roy Njuguna\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Overview**\n",
    "---\n",
    "The goal of this analysis is to provide insights into the risks\n",
    "associated with different aircraft models to help the company\n",
    "make informed decisions as it explores the aviation industry. As\n",
    "the company seeks to expand into operating both commercial\n",
    "and private airplanes, understanding the factors that\n",
    "contribute to aviation accidents is essential. This analysis\n",
    "identifies trends and patterns from historical accident data,\n",
    "focusing on aircraft models with higher safety records. The\n",
    "results will guide the selection of lower-risk aircraft, ensuring\n",
    "the company makes a sound investment as it enters this new\n",
    "market.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Business Problem**\n",
    "---\n",
    "The company is expanding into the aviation industry as part\n",
    "of its strategy to diversify its portfolio. Specifically, the focus is\n",
    "on acquiring and operating aircraft for both commercial and\n",
    "private use. However, there is limited knowledge about the\n",
    "potential risks associated with different types of aircraft. The\n",
    "task is to analyze and identify which aircraft models present\n",
    "the lowest risk, providing actionable insights to guide the\n",
    "decision-making process for purchasing aircraft. This will\n",
    "support the new aviation division in making informed and\n",
    "strategic choices as they enter the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Data**\n",
    "---\n",
    "● Data Source: The analysis utilized the Aviation Accident\n",
    "Database & Synopses, covering aviation incidents up to 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "● Dataset Overview: The dataset includes critical variables such\n",
    "as aircraft type, damage level, weather conditions, and total\n",
    "fatalities to assess accident trends and risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "● Analysis Approach: Data cleaning, aggregation, and\n",
    "visualization techniques were applied to identify patterns and\n",
    "inform risk assessment for aircraft selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Methods**\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Results**\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Aviation accidents have significantly decreased since 1982, highlighting improvements in safety protocols, regulations, technology, pilot training, and risk management.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Local Image](images/years.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "California and Florida lead in aviation accidents, likely due to their high air traffic and major aviation hubs. In contrast, Delaware and Washington, D.C., report fewer accidents, reflecting lower aviation activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Local Image](images/states.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Aviation accidents vary by season, with higher rates in summer months like July and August, likely due to increased travel activity. In contrast, winter months see fewer accidents, possibly due to reduced operations or stricter safety measures during adverse weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Local Image](images/seasons.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot reveals a notable decline in aviation fatalities since 1982, highlighting improvements in safety protocols, regulations, technology, pilot training, and risk management within the aviation industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Local Image](images/fatalities.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant insight is that personal flights account for a substantial portion of aviation accidents, emphasizing the importance of analyzing the unique risks and operational challenges associated with this segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Local Image](images/flight_purpose.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis indicates that turbo engines are associated with fewer accidents than reciprocating engines, suggesting they may provide enhanced reliability or are typically utilized in safer operational environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Local Image](images/engines.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis shows that aircraft with fewer engines are more frequently involved in accidents, likely due to the heightened vulnerability of single-engine planes during emergencies. Additionally, Cessna airplanes exhibit a higher accident rate, possibly reflecting their widespread use and popularity in personal and training flights, which increases their overall exposure to risk.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## **Conclusions**\n",
    "---\n",
    "● Prioritize Aircraft with Turbojet and Turbofan Engines\n",
    "Aircraft equipped with turbojet and turbofan engines have shown\n",
    "lower accident rates. It is recommended that your company prioritize\n",
    "these aircraft types for both commercial and private operations to\n",
    "ensure better safety performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "● Focus on Public Aircraft for Commercial Operations\n",
    "Public aircraft consistently exhibit fewer accidents than personal\n",
    "aircraft. For your company's new aviation division, acquiring public\n",
    "aircraft will reduce operational risks and uphold higher safety\n",
    "standards, critical for commercial operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "● Address Risks Associated with Personal Aircraft\n",
    "Personal aircraft have higher accident rates. If your company intends\n",
    "to operate private aircraft, mitigating these risks through strict safety\n",
    "protocols, regular maintenance, and comprehensive pilot training\n",
    "will be essential to ensure safe operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "● Implement Risk Mitigation Strategies for VMC Conditions\n",
    "Many accidents occur in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC),\n",
    "which are generally considered less risky. Targeted pilot training and\n",
    "adherence to safety protocols in good weather conditions will help\n",
    "minimize accidents, ensuring safety in both commercial and private\n",
    "operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "● Plan for Seasonal Risk Variations\n",
    "Accidents are more frequent during the summer months. Additional\n",
    "safety measures, including intensive training, extra oversight, and\n",
    "up-to-date maintenance, should be implemented during peak\n",
    "seasons. During winter, focus can shift to preventative measures for\n",
    "the upcoming summer period.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Next Steps**\n",
    "---\n",
    "● Investigate Aircraft Safety by Model\n",
    "Analyze the makes and models with the lowest severe\n",
    "accident rates to identify the safest options for both\n",
    "commercial and private use, guiding smarter purchasing\n",
    "decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "● Examine Flight Purpose and Safety Risks\n",
    "Assess the correlation between flight purposes (commercial vs.\n",
    "private) and accident severity to determine the safest aircraft\n",
    "types suited for your company's needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "● Develop Weather-Related Safety Protocols\n",
    "Model the impact of various weather conditions on accident\n",
    "severity and implement predictive models to optimize flight\n",
    "planning, minimizing risks in adverse weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "● Assess Engine Configuration and Safety\n",
    "Analyze the link between aircraft engine configuration\n",
    "(number of engines) and accident severity to select aircraft\n",
    "configurations that lower accident risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "● Geographical Risk Analysis\n",
    "Focus on regions with higher accident rates (e.g., California,\n",
    "Florida, Texas) to implement targeted safety measures,\n",
    "reducing risks in high-risk areas.\n",
